## Introduction

We value working on real solutions to real problems, and as such we think the best way to understand your capabilities is to give you the opportunity to solve a problem similar to the ones we solve on a daily basis. As the next step in our process, we ask that you write a simple console program that monitors HTTP traffic on your machine. Treat this as an opportunity to show us how you would write something efficient, scalable, well-structured and maintainable.

* We will primarily be looking at the following criteria:
* Logical and maintainable code structure
* Efficient use of data structures
* Comments and unit tests
* Correctness
* Insight into potential improvements

We ask that you submit what you've completed - we promise we will read it carefully, even if it is incomplete! We also recommend leaving at least 15 minutes to write instructions and how you would improve the program.

## The problem / assignment

HTTP log monitoring console program

* Read a CSV-encoded HTTP access log. It should either take the file as a parameter or read from standard input
* Example log file (first line is the header):

  ```log
  "remotehost","rfc931","authuser","date","request","status","bytes"
  "10.0.0.1","-","apache",1549574332,"GET /api/user HTTP/1.0",200,1234
  "10.0.0.4","-","apache",1549574333,"GET /report HTTP/1.0",200,1136
  "10.0.0.1","-","apache",1549574334,"GET /api/user HTTP/1.0",200,1194
  "10.0.0.4","-","apache",1549574334,"POST /report HTTP/1.0",404,1307
  ```

* For every 10 seconds of log lines, display stats about the traffic during those 10s: the sections of the web site with the most hits, as well as statistics that might be useful for debugging. A section is defined as being what's before the second '/' in the resource section of the log line. For example, the section for "/api/user" is "/api" and the section for "/report" is "/report".
* Whenever total traffic for the past 2 minutes exceeds a certain number on average, print a message to the console saying that "High traffic generated an alert - hits = {value}, triggered at {time}". The default threshold should be 10 requests per second but should be configurable.
* Whenever the total traffic drops again below that value on average for the past 2 minutes, print another message detailing when the alert recovered, +/- a second.
* Consider the efficiency of your solution and how it would scale to process high volumes of log lines - don't assume you can read the entire file into memory.
* Write your solution as you would any piece of code that others might need to modify and maintain, both in terms of structure and style.
* Write a test for the alerting logic.
* Explain how youâ€™d improve on this application design.
