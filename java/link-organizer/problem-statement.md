## Coding Test

Build a small Spring Boot application with the following capabilities:
* REST API
* Web interface - Thymeleaf (or other view layer)
* Spring Security
* database storage (sql or no-sql, external or in-memory)
* dependency management
* some test coverage

The application can do anything you’d like:
* e.g. track your bike/movie/rock/etc collection
* e.g. take in a series of map coordinates and calculate the fastest way to connect to
each coordinate
* e.g. given city sports team names, generate new ones automatically with some new
input
* e.g. given a family tree (in JSON), visualize the graph in a web interface and allow for
updates

Delivery:
* deliver in zip file via email w/o dependencies
* any special instructions
* write-up of things learned

## Product/Feature pitch
* Write a few paragraphs about a new product or feature that you think would be a
good idea to build. Discuss the user experience, the tech stack and the target market.
* This product or feature doesn’t have to be revenue generating. It can be frivolous,
creative and/or pragmatic.
* If you’d like to include diagrams to help illustrate what you think is important, that’s
great, but not required.
